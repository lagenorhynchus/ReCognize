# ReCognize
In this project, we aim to build a system that screens for Alzheimer's disease using audio data. The system will analyze audio recordings of patients' speech and use machine learning techniques to do an early-stage classification of their symptoms to see if those symptoms track with AD. This is not meant to replace a diagnosis by a neurologist.
